            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
                This project presents a Smart Construction Implementation Plan for a G+2 residential building.
                The development integrates Building Information Modelling (BIM), Internet of Things (IoT),
                Artificial Intelligence (AI), Robotics and Automation, and Digital Twin technologies to enhance
                construction efficiency, safety, and lifecycle performance. Since automation, data systems, and 
                information technology have all advanced quickly, the construction sector is undergoing a 
                significant shift due to digital transformation. Intelligent technologies are progressively 
                replacing or adding value to traditional building processes in order to increase productivity,
                accuracy, safety, and sustainability. Additionally, digital tools may be utilised to more 
                intelligently and holistically plan, develop, and run buildings during their lifetime. 
                Particularly in contemporary constructions where building performance, comfort, and longevity 
                are important concerns, this move to smart buildings attracts attention. The use of digital models, 
                real-time data, and automated procedures to create structures that are not only physically sound but
                also responsive and efficient is known as smart construction. Technology may improve the design process,
                increase the productivity of construction, and improve operations after the project is planned and executed.
                The G+2 residential building's smart construction implementation plan will support intelligent and energy-efficient living.
                In order to maximise the construction process and long-term building performance, the project investigates strategic digital 
                technology implementation techniques.
            </p>
            <p>
                The selected project is a G+2 residential block that will house a few dwelling units and is intended to be built in a city setting.
                The bottom level and two more above stories make up the structure, which offers a straightforward yet functional home design.
                Living rooms, bedrooms, kitchens, bathrooms, and circulation areas consisting of stairwells and hallways are all found on floors. 
                In addition to being accessible to inhabitants, the design promotes the modern urban lifestyle of comfort and space conservation.
                Residential structures are the ideal target for smart construction technology because of their continuous presence and lengthy development projects.
                In cities where resources are in great demand, residential structures have been found to consume a significant amount of energy.
                By monitoring the temperature, gas levels, and water leaks in real time, digital technologies help improve indoor security.
                Residential units' repetition demonstrates that the project can be mechanised and that robots can be used in the building process.
                Standardised design elements enable automated systems to complete tasks more accurately and reliably, improve quality, and reduce 
                construction time and labour dangers. Additionally, residential structures need constant upkeep, which makes them ideal for remote
                monitoring throughout their existence using cutting-edge data-driven systems.

            <p>
                A detailed 3D BIM model was developed to represent the architectural layout,
                floor levels, elevations, and sectional views. The model serves as the digital
                foundation for integrating smart technologies throughout the building lifecycle.
